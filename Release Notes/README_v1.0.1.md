1. I would like to express my special thanks of gratitude to my thesis advisor [Asst. Prof. Önder ŞUVAK](https://github.com/osuvak), who gave me the golden opportunity to do this wonderful project on the topic Shared Object Building Makefiles. He shared his valuable knowledge and experience from the beginning to the end of my graduate education. He not only shared his profound scientific knowledge with me but also taught me great lessons in life. His support, suggestions, and encouragement gave me the drive and will to complete this work. I came to know about so many new things I am really thankful to him.
